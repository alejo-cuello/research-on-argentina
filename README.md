# 📊 World Development Indicators – Argentina

This is a personal project in which I apply the tools and knowledge acquired through several Data Science courses at Platzi. The project focuses on analyzing **World Development Indicators** related to **Argentina**, with the goal of finding relationships between employment and education indicators.

## 🧠 What I'm Doing
This is an **ongoing project** where I’m practicing and applying the complete data science workflow:

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning**  
- 🔄 **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**  
- 📈 **Initial Processing and Visualizations**

## 📚 Skills and Tools Applied
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebooks, CookieCutter)
- Data wrangling
- Descriptive statistics
