    "MCAR: Missing Completely At Random -> Data deletion or imputation (imputation is more recommended)\n",
    "    The missing values in the data set occur completely at random. They don't depend on any other data. Example: when a device such a security camera stops working.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAR: Missing At Random -> Single or multiple imputation (consider one or several columns during imputation)\n",
    "    The missing values depends on other observed values. Example: devices required a periodic maintenance to ensure consistent operation, so the data will be missing during those maintenance period.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNAR: Missing Not At Random -> This kind of missing values require to perform sensivity analysis\n",
    "    The missing values depends on the missing values themselves. They are very difficult to identify. And we may not even know that the data is missing. Example: tools have limitations. When attempting to track data out in areas beyond the measurement range, missing values are generated. Example, a scale not detecting very small or very large values.\n"
